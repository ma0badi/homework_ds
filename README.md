This is my submission of the Website Scrapping Homework. I have used the Flipkart website with 'Gaming Laptop' search for this project. 
I used BeautifulSoup for scrapping the website. My final data consisted the Name, Price and Review of the given laptop.
I saved the scrapped data in CSV file and used pandas to perform EDA.
From the Title, I extracted model_name, RAM and storage using pandas.
